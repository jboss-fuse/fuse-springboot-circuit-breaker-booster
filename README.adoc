= Circuit Breaker - Fuse Booster

== Overview
The Fuse circuit breaker booster consists of two related services:

* A _name service_, which returns a name to greet, and
* A _greetings service_, which invokes the name service to get a name and then returns the string, `Hello, NAME`.

In this demonstration, the Hystrix circuit breaker is inserted between the greetings service and the name service.
If the name service becomes unavailable, the greetings service can fall back to an alternative behaviour and respond to the client immediately, instead of blocking while it waits for the name service to restart.

== Deployment options

This booster can run in the following modes:

* Standalone on your machine
* Single-node OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift Online at link:{launchURL}[]

The most effective way to demonstrate the circuit breaker is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.
For more details about running this booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This booster requires Java 8 JDK or greater and Maven 3.3.x or greater.


== Running the booster standalone on your machine
You can run this booster as a standalone project on your local machine:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.
. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. In two separate shell prompts, run the services as follows:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd name-service
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=8081
----
and
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd greetings-service
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
. Visit link:http://localhost:8080[] and follow the instructions on that page.

== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your booster there.
A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

IMPORTANT: You need to run this example on Container Development Kit 3.3 or OpenShift 3.7.
Both of these products have suitable Fuse images pre-installed.

To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pods for the `name-service` application and for the `greetings-service` application have both started up.

. Just above the entry for the `greetings-service` application on the `Overview` page, there is a URL of the form `http://greetings-service-test.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.
Click on the URL to access the greetings service application and follow the instructions on that page.


== Running the booster on OpenShift Online
You can deploy the circuit breaker booster directly to OpenShift Online when you create the project at link:{launchURL}[].

. Visit link:{launchURL}[].
. At the *Deployment step*, select *Use OpenShift Online*.
. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new *Circuit Breaker* project using the *Fuse* runtime.

NOTE: As part of the process of creating this booster, link:{launchURL}[] sets up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your Single-node OpenShift Cluster or OpenShift Online Web Console.
